## 2. How We Use Your Information  
- **Service Provision:** Access tokens are used to retrieve your QuickBooks Online data.  
- **Improvements:** Anonymized usage data helps us fix bugs and plan features.

## 3. Data Sharing  
We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal or financial data. We may share anonymized usage metrics with third‑party analytics services (e.g. Application Insights), but only in aggregate form.

## 4. Third‑Party Services
